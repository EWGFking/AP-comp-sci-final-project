# Mason B – Final Portfolio Project

## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm Mason B, a student developer with a passion for problem-solving, learning new technologies, and building cool things with code. Over the past year, I've grown my skills in web development and programming through hands-on projects and collaborative learning.

## 📚 Project Overview

This portfolio website is the culmination of my learning throughout the year in Computer Science. It showcases my progress, highlights the projects I’ve built, and reflects the knowledge I’ve gained in programming languages like C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through this project, I’ve learned how to:
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Debug code efficiently and independently
- Collaborate with peers and contribute meaningfully to group projects
- Build responsive and interactive web applications

## 🌐 What’s Included in the Portfolio

The site includes:
- A professional introduction about me
- Descriptions of key programming projects I completed
- Live demos of interactive applications
- Downloadable files for offline use
- Clean, modern design using HTML and CSS
