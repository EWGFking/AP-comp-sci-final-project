# Mason W – Final Portfolio Project

## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm Mason W, a student developer with a passion for problem-solving, learning new technologies, and building cool things with code. Over the past year, I've grown my skills in web development and programming through hands-on projects and collaborative learning.

## 📚 Project Overview

This portfolio website is the culmination of my learning throughout the year in AP Computer Science. It showcases my growth as a developer, highlights several projects I’ve completed, and reflects the skills I’ve gained in C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through this project, I’ve learned how to:
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Debug code efficiently and independently
- Collaborate with peers and contribute meaningfully to group projects
- Build responsive and interactive web applications

## 🌐 What’s Included in the Portfolio

The site includes:
- A personal introduction
- Descriptions of key programming projects
- Live demos hosted online
- A downloadable game project
- Clean, responsive design using HTML and CSS
