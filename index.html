      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a student programmer who loves problem-solving, learning new tech, and building things with coding.</p>
      <p>This year in Computer Science, I learned how to break down complex problems, debug code efficiently, and collaborate with others using C++, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>
        <h2> Project 1: Rock paper scisors game  </h2>
      <p>for this project me and a partner had to make a simple game, so we chose to make rock, paper, scisors in C++. the game worked by first asking you to play, after you selecting your move the computer makes a random selection of rock, paper or scisors. either win or lose the game would display who won.</p>

      <h2>Project 2: Java Clock</h2>
      <p>for this project me and a partner had to make a program using HTML, CSS and Javascript. the project was a clock that told you the exact time of wherever you were at. we used HTML to display the numbers and the font, the CSS was used for the background of the clock. The Javascript was used to make the clock function and to display the corrext numbers. </p>
